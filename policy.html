                    <p>Effective Date: March 19, 2024</p>

                    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use our note-taking app.</p>

                    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected</h2>
                    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. You do not need to create an account to use the app, and we do not access or collect any identifying information such as your name, email, location, or device information.</p>

                    <h2>2. Notes and iCloud Sync</h2>
                    <p>All notes you create within the app are stored locally on your device and synced securely with your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit. This ensures that your notes are available across your Apple devices. We do not have access to your notes or any data stored in your iCloud.</p>

                    <h2>3. No Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>This app does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or external services. Your data stays entirely within your device and your iCloud account.</p>

                    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>Your notes are stored and synced using Apple's secure infrastructure. We rely on Apple's privacy and security mechanisms to protect your data.</p>

                    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>If we ever make changes to this policy, we will update it here in the app or on our website. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.</p>
